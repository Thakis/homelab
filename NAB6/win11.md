Overview

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to installing Windows 10 on a Proxmox server. It covers the necessary preparations, installation steps, and post-installation configurations.
Preparation Steps

    Download Windows 10 ISO
        Visit the Microsoft website and download the Media Creation Tool to obtain the Windows 10 ISO file. This is essential for the installation process.

    Download VirtIO Drivers
        Download the VirtIO drivers for Windows from the Proxmox website. These drivers are crucial for proper communication between the Windows VM and the Proxmox host.

    Upload Files to Proxmox
        Log in to your Proxmox host and navigate to the local storage. Upload both the Windows 10 ISO and the VirtIO drivers.

Installation Steps

    Create a New Virtual Machine (VM)
        Right-click on your Proxmox host and select "Create VM."
        Assign an ID and name (e.g., vm-Windows 10).
        Select the Windows 10 ISO as the boot disk.

    Configure VM Settings
        Set the desired number of cores (e.g., 4) and RAM (e.g., 6 GB).
        Add a second disk for the VirtIO drivers.

    Start the VM
        Start the VM and connect via VNC. The Windows installer will load.

    Install Windows
        Follow the prompts to install Windows. When asked for a disk, you may need to load the VirtIO drivers to see the disk.

    Post-Installation Configuration
        After installation, install the VirtIO drivers to ensure all hardware functions correctly. This includes network and audio drivers.

Final Steps

    Remote Desktop Setup
        Set a password for the user account and enable remote desktop connections. This allows access to the VM without needing VNC.

    Resource Management
        Adjust the VM settings in Proxmox to ensure that the resource allocation reflects the actual usage. This helps in optimizing performance.

    Cleanup
        Remove any unnecessary ISO files from the VM settings to prevent confusion in future sessions.

Important Notes

    Always ensure that you have backups of important data before making significant changes to your virtual machines.
    If you encounter issues with drivers, refer to the Proxmox documentation for troubleshooting tips.

This guide should help you successfully install and configure Windows 10 on your Proxmox server while ensuring that all necessary steps are clear and easy to follow!
