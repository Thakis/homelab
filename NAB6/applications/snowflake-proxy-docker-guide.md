# Snowflake Proxy Setup Guide with Docker

## Overview
Snowflake is a tool that helps people access the internet safely and privately, especially in regions with internet censorship.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Docker Compose (optional but recommended)
- Stable internet connection
- Open ports for incoming WebRTC connections

## Installation Methods

### Option 1: Docker Run Command
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name snowflake-proxy \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  torbrowser/snowflake-proxy
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  snowflake-proxy:
    image: torbrowser/snowflake-proxy
    container_name: snowflake-proxy
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
You can customize the Snowflake proxy using environment variables:

- `SNOWFLAKE_BROKER`: Custom broker URL
- `SNOWFLAKE_CAPACITY`: Maximum number of concurrent clients
- `SNOWFLAKE_KEEP_LOCAL_ADDRESSES`: Keep local network addresses

Example:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name snowflake-proxy \
  -e SNOWFLAKE_CAPACITY=10 \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  torbrowser/snowflake-proxy
```

## Monitoring and Logs

### Check Container Status
```bash
docker ps | grep snowflake-proxy
```

### View Logs
```bash
docker logs snowflake-proxy
```

## Security Considerations
- Use a firewall to restrict access
- Keep Docker and the Snowflake image updated
- Consider using a VPN for additional privacy

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure port 9000 is open and not blocked
- Check Docker logs for any connection issues
- Verify your network allows WebRTC connections

## Updating
```bash
docker pull torbrowser/snowflake-proxy
docker restart snowflake-proxy
```

## Network Requirements
- Requires incoming WebRTC connections
- Recommended: Stable, high-bandwidth internet connection
- Open UDP and TCP ports for WebRTC

## Ethical Considerations
- Running a Snowflake proxy helps people access free information
- Respect local laws and regulations
- Understand the potential impacts in your region
