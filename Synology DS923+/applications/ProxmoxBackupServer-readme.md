## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Preparing the Synology NAS

- Enable Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) or Docker on the NAS
- Download the Proxmox Backup Server ISO image from the official website

### 2. Creating and Configuring the Virtual Machine

- Create a new VM in VMM with the following specs:
  - Assign appropriate CPU, RAM, and storage
  - Attach the PBS ISO image as the boot medium
- Start the VM and follow the PBS installation instructions

### 3. Network and Storage Integration

- Assign a static IP to the VM for stable network access
- Mount additional storage directories or external drives as PBS datastores

## üîÑ Backup Synchronization Setup

- Configure pull sync jobs in PBS to sync backups from other PBS instances or storage locations
- Set up remote connections using hostname, port, and authentication credentials
- Schedule regular sync intervals to maintain updated backups

---

## üßπ Maintenance and Automation

- Create prune jobs to automatically remove old backups based on retention policies
- Set up garbage collection (GC) jobs to free unused data and optimize storage
- Schedule regular backup jobs for connected Proxmox VE instances
